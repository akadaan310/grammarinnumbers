### GIN-H-000 The founding question *(A. Kadaan)*
- **Statement.** Arithmetic and elementary number theory can be described as computational grammars: objects, symbols, states, admissible operations, transitions, invariants, information requirements and machinery, such that "undefined" expressions are explained by which grammatical condition fails.
- **Status.** **Reformulated** into H-001 … H-035. The descriptive half is supported throughout: every operation studied has a CGT operational grammar, and every failure studied is classified by layer and cause (GIN-DEF-061, GIN-THM-001, GIN-THM-004). Whether the description yields new *mathematics* is answered "not so far" (RESULTS §G).
